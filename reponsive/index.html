<p> These are all of the people in my Family. We are a family of five, and from Cleveland, Ohio. My Dad is a Cardiologist at Summa Health in Akron, Ohio, a stem cell researcher and CEO of Black Baret Life Science in Houston, Texas. My Mom was a stay-at-home Mom, although passed away four years ago from a brain tumor. I have a sister who is 21 years old, she studies BioMedical Engineering at the Ohio State University. My Brother is 18 years old, and studies hospitality and sports management at Kent State University. </p>
