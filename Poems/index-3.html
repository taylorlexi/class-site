<p>You may write me down in history</p>
<p>With your bitter, twisted lies,</p>
<p>You may tread me in the very dirt</p>
<p>But still, like dust, I'll rise.</p>

<p>Does my sassiness upset you? </p>
<p>Why are you beset with gloom? </p>
<p>'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells</p>
<p>Pumping in my living room.</p>

<p>Just like moons and like suns,</p>
<p>With the certainty of tides,</p>
<p>Just like hopes springing high,</p>
<p>Still I'll rise.</p>

<p>Did you want to see me broken?</p> 
<p>Bowed head and lowered eyes? </p>
<p>Shoulders falling down like teardrops.</p>
<p>Weakened by my soulful cries.</p>

<p>Does my haughtiness offend you? </p>
<p>Don't you take it awful hard</p>
<p>'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines</p>
<p>Diggin' in my own back yard.</p>

<p>You may shoot me with your words,</p>
<p>You may cut me with your eyes,</p>
<p>You may kill me with your hatefulness,</p>
<p>But still, like air, I'll rise.</p>

<p>Does my sexiness upset you? </p>
<p>Does it come as a surprise</p>
<p>That I dance like I've got diamonds</p>
<p>At the meeting of my thighs? </p>

<p>Out of the huts of history's shame</p>
<p>I rise</p>
<p>Up from a past that's rooted in pain</p>
<p>I rise</p>
<p>I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,</p>
<p>Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.</p>
<p>Leaving behind nights of terror and fear</p>
<p>I rise</p>
<p>Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear</p>
<p>I rise</p>
<p>Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,</p>
<p>I am the dream and the hope of the slave.</p>
<p>I rise</p>
<p>I rise</p>
<p>I rise.</p>
<br>
<p> Still I Rise</p>
<p> Maya Angelou 1978</p>
