<p> Still I Rise</p>
<br>
<p> Maya Angelou</p>
<p>1978</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="poem">
<div class="one">
<p>You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
<br>
You may tread me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.
</p>
</div>

<div class="two">
<p>Does my sassiness upset you? 
Why are you beset with gloom? 
<br>
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.</p></div>

<div class="three">
<p> Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
<br>
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.</p></div>

<div class="four">
<p>Did you want to see me broken? 
Bowed head and lowered eyes? 
<br>
Shoulders falling down like teardrops.
Weakened by my soulful cries.</p></div>

<div class="five">
<p>Does my haughtiness offend you? 
Don't you take it awful hard
<br>
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin' in my own back yard.</p></div>

<div class="six">
<p>You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
<br>
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I'll rise.</p></div>

<div class="seven">
<p>Does my sexiness upset you? 
Does it come as a surprise
<br>
That I dance like I've got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs? </p>
</div>

<div class="eight">
<p>Out of the huts of history's shame
I rise
Up from a past that's rooted in pain
<br>
I rise
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.</p>
</div>
<div class="nine">
<p>Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
<br>
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
I rise
<br>
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
<br>
I rise
I rise
I rise.
