<h1>You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
<br>
You may tread me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.</h1>

<h2>Does my sassiness upset you? 
Why are you beset with gloom? 
<br>
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.</h2>

<h1>Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
<br>
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.</h1>

<h2>Did you want to see me broken? 
Bowed head and lowered eyes? 
<br>
Shoulders falling down like teardrops.
Weakened by my soulful cries.</h2>

<h1>Does my haughtiness offend you? 
Don't you take it awful hard
<br>
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin' in my own back yard.</h1>

<h2>You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
<br>
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I'll rise.</h2>

<h1>Does my sexiness upset you? 
Does it come as a surprise
<br>
That I dance like I've got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs? </h1>

<h2>Out of the huts of history's shame
I rise
<br>
Up from a past that's rooted in pain
I rise</h2>
<br>
<h1>I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
<br>
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
I rise</h1>
<br>
<h2>Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.</h2>
<h3>I rise</h3>
<h4>I rise</h4>
<h5>I rise.</h5>
