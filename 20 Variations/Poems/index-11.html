 <h1>Still I Rise

 Maya Angelou

1978</h1>

<div class="text">
<p>You may</p>
<p>write me down</p>
<p>in history With your</p>
<p>bitter, twisted lies, You may </p>
<p>tread me in the</p>
<p> very dirt But</p>
 <p>still, like </p>
 <p>dust,</p>
 <p> I'll rise.</p>
</div>
<div class="ok">
<h2>Does my sassiness upset you? 
Why are you beset with gloom? 
</h2>
<h3>'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.</h3>

<h4>Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
</h4>
<h5>Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.</h5>

<h2>Did you want to see me broken? 
Bowed head and lowered eyes? </h2>
<h3>Shoulders falling down like teardrops.
Weakened by my soulful cries.</h3>

<h4>Does my haughtiness offend you? 
Don't you take it awful hard</h4>
<h5>'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin' in my own back yard.</h5>

<h2>You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,</h2>
<h3>You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I'll rise.</h3>
</div>
<div class="ko">
<p>Does my sexiness upset you? </p>
<p>Does it come as a surprise</p>
<p>That I dance like I've got diamonds</p>
<p>At the meeting of my thighs? </p>

<p>Out of the huts of history's shame</p>
<p>I rise</p>
<p>Up from a past that's rooted in pain</p>
<p>I rise</p>
<p>I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,</p>
<p>Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.</p>
<p>Leaving behind nights of terror and fear</p>
<p>I rise</p>
<p>Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear</p>
<p>I rise</p>
<p>Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,</p>
<p>I am the dream and the hope of the slave.</p>
<p>I rise</p>
<p>I rise</p>
<p>I rise.</p>
