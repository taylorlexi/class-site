<p> Two poems about the color blue</p>
<div class="poem-1">
<p>"When you are sick
Helpless
Stuck on bed rest
That blue is what keeps you alive
That liquid blue
The blue that eases all the pain
The blue that goes down so soothingly
Liquid blue
Blue like the ocean you'll never swim in
Blue like the sky you'll never touch
Blue like the tears that roll
If you don't have it"</p>
</div>
<div class="poem-2">
<p>"Colorless and yet so colorful.
Such depth you hold, boldly you stand out. You reside in the skies and the deep seas, without you they seize to exist. 
Such royalty you are, you linger peace and serenity visible within a colbat glass. Indigo plants spit you out on the wings of lycaenidae and let them stand out with such radiance feeling so blue, how you strike me with calmness.
You bring life to the lifeless. 
Without you there is darkness . 
Blue you give me life."</p>
