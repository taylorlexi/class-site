    <p>The 'Happiness Workshop' is the place for you, a crazy New Yorker to come and RELAX. We can thank Mayor Bill deBlasio for setting up the event, which every New Yorker needs to attend. The event is for all New Yorkers, young and old to seperate themselves from their daily routine, go outside, and think about their own sense of being and happiness. The event is on the first day of Spring to get New Yorkers in a good mindset and excited for warmer weather. The event will have tons of activities ranging from yoga classes, to spiritual readings, to dodgeball games, to shopping games. The event is free and we hope as many people that need desbriefing from the cold, snowy winter will come!</p>
